# Alz_view

## A Shiny dashboard to query the large Alzheimer's disease proteomics study from [Johnson et. al, 2022](%5Bhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00999-y%5D(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00999-y%22,)).

The data consists of the quantification of over 13k peptides from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 516 human subjects. The data can be found [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-021-00999-y/MediaObjects/41593_2021_999_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx)

A hosted version of the app can found [here](https://wtoddfarmer.shinyapps.io/alz_view/).

This repository contains code both to process the original spreadsheet published as supplementary data with the Nature Neuroscience paper as well as the code to run the webapp.
